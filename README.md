# geek-streak-challenge
This repository is dedicated to my participation in the Geek Streak Challenge, starting from 23rd July 2024. The goal is to solve the Problem of the Day (POTD) on GeeksforGeeks Practice platform for 30 consecutive days, document the progress, and get rewarded for maintaining the streak.
